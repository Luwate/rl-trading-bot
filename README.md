## RL-BASED CRYPTO-CURRENCY TRADING BOT

## INTRODUCTION

Algorithmic trading has transformed financial markets, but traditional strategies struggle to adapt to changing conditions. 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution by enabling trading bots to learn from market data and optimize strategies in real-time.
This project explores an RL-based trading bot that dynamically adjusts decisions to maximize profits while managing risk. We cover key components like environment modeling, reward functions, and backtesting. By leveraging AI, our bot aims to outperform conventional strategies, providing a smarter, more adaptive approach to trading.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Problem Statement:
Traditional algorithmic trading relies on fixed rules, struggling to adapt to volatile markets. This leads to missed opportunities, poor risk management, and reduced profitability.

Key Challenges
1. Market Volatility – Static strategies fail in unpredictable conditions.
2. Suboptimal Decisions – Fixed models can’t learn or adapt.
3. Inefficient Risk Management – Poor balance between risk and reward.
4. High Costs – Manual strategy adjustments require oversight.
5. Competitive Disadvantage – AI-driven firms outperform traditional traders.
